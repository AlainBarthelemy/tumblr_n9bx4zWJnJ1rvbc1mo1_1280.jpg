# tumblr_n9bx4zWJnJ1rvbc1mo1_1280.jpg - versioned image

This repository host a versioned image.

## Content

Two files are used to create infinite variations of an image. A source file (.src) and an image file (.jpg).
The source file is a description of the image as a plain text file containing an hex code. The image file is crafted by converting this source code into a jpg file. 

## Workflow

New variations can be created by editing the source code and saving it as a jpg.
Any tool may be used to change the code and create new variations as long as each commit contains corresponding source and image.
Once variations have reach to an ended form, a release with a new version number may be created.
